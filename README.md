#About Author

This is maybe the first big project I've made with someone else. Initially was built in with handmade HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP in back with MySQL.
It was two years ago, when I was still studying.

The intention of this project is to do all the thins I wanted the old version to do, adn a lot more. To make it a real usefull webapp.
